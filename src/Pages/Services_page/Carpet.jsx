                  Carpets act as filters, trapping dust, dirt, and allergens
                  over time. Regular foot traffic can push these particles
                  deeper into the carpet fibers, making it necessary to clean
                  them to maintain a healthy indoor environment.

              Firstly, our professionals will pre inspect the type , condition ,
              and material of the carpet or rug. To identify any specific stains
              , spots , or areas of concern.Then, we will do colorfast testing ,
              in this testing they will test a small, inconspicuous area for
              colour fastness to ensure that the cleaning process won’t cause
              colour bleeding or fading. Next, we will do thoroughly vacuum the
              carpet or rugs to remove soil and debris.
              <br />
              <br />
              Secondly, we apply pre- treatment to solution to the high traffic
              area, stains and spots. After that , our professionals will
              agitate your carpet or rug fibre with brush or rotary machine (if
              needed) to loosen imbedded dirt. The 3rd step is HOT WATER

              rugs or situations where moisture is concern specialists may opt
              for low - moisture cleaning such as dry cleaning.
              <br />
              <br />
              The 4th step will include the process of making carpet dry quickly
              by turning on fans or opening the windows. In the last, you will
